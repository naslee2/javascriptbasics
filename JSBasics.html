            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
              <p>JavaScript is a cross platform, onject-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremly popular for a variety of reasons. it is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host enviroment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these enviroments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
              <div class="tab2">
                  <ul>
                    <li><a href="Variable Declaration">Variable Declaration</a> Javascript are containers for storing data values - image a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identifed with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.<font color="purple"> var x;</font></li>
                    <li><a href="Variable Assignment">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to Javascript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. <font color="purple"> var x = 10;</font></li>
                    <li><a href="Data Types">Data Types</a> Data Types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <font color="purple">true</font> or <font color="purple">false;</font> <font color="purple">null</font> - null aka nothing; Number <font color="purple">42</font> or <font color="purple">3.14159;</font> String - <font color="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</font> Array - <font color="purple">1,'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</font> and Object - <font color="purple">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</font></li>
                    <li><a href="Conditionals">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <font color="purple">if</font> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <font color="purple">else if</font> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <font color="purple">else</font> we execute this block of code;</li>
                    <li><a href="Loops">Loops</a> There are many differebt kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times ande then you stop. That is the loop!</li>
                    <li><a href="Function">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and gen started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
